// Using "service": "dbt" instead of "python"
// The dbt service will be the primary container where your VS Code editor will operate.
// Your workspace and environment will be set up based on the dbt service configuration.
// Any commands or tools you execute within the VS Code terminal will run in the context of the dbt container.
// This means any scripts, commands, or dbt-related tasks you run will have access to the environment variables and dependencies defined in the dbt service.
// The extensions specified in devcontainer.json (ms-python.python and ms-toolsai.jupyter) will be installed in the dbt container due to the above.
