    "* Saving key in the environmental variables:\n",
    "    * When dealing with sensitive information like API keys that you don't want to expose publicly in your GitHub repository, one common approach is to use environment variables. Environment variables are variables that are set outside of the code and can be accessed by the code during runtime.\n",
    "* Accessing the key\n",
    "    * During the Docker image build process, Docker itself doesn't directly access environment variables for use within the application code. Instead, Docker can be instructed to set environment variables within the container at runtime, and these variables are accessible by the application running inside the container.\n",
    "    * Thus, I will let the way to run the python locally here in case you want to access the environment variable. However, when using docker, you would need to expose the key in the docker compose file.\n",
    "    * If you don't want to expose sensitive information like API keys directly in your Docker Compose file, you can use _Docker secrets_ or external configuration files to securely manage these values.\n",
    "* (To be continued...) Using Docker Secrets to encrypt the keys"
